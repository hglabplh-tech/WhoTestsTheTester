#### WhoTestsTheTester a documentation / learning project for test theories

This project contains an article for testing and code examples for the different ways of testing. The project also contains many examples of how to divide logic in a way that testing and quality are supported by the development and planning.
The article here is not complete and since it gets more and more complex I will move it to another project and give it free the time it is ready in the second draft.
The examples for coding remain here and will grow 

### Next todo's
*  Working on experimental datatypes
*  Building an example MVC App.
*  How to sign documents (Bouncy Castle and Java RT) because this is free software.
*  How to handle EU trust lists and work with eIDAS as well as with BSI standards
*  Build a save TLS / SSL transport layer.
*  A few examples of JDBC.

These are planned features and are thought to learn.
