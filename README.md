#### WhoTestsTheTester a documentation / learning project for test theories

This project contains an article for testing and code examples for the different ways of testing. The project also contains many examples of how to divide logic in a way that testing and quality are supported by the development and planning.
The article here is not complete and since it gets more and more complex I will move it to another project and give it free the time it is ready in the second draft.
